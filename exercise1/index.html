		My name is James.  My major is Environmental Science with a minor in GIS.  I am a GIS Intern for the 



	City of Des Moines Parks and Rec Dept. and a lab/GIS technician for the ISU Wetland Lab.



	I have zero experience with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, but am ready to learn.  



	I have briefly looked through some python and R tutorials, and am a newbie when it comes to coding.  



	As far as GIS experience goes, I collect feature data for local parks to create maps for fun in my free time.



	I am currently working with The City of Des Moines on entering data from a geospatial botanical survey that 



	was conducted a few years back.  It is very interesting!  I am also working with the ISU Wetlands Lab on raster analysis.



	I hope to learn how to apply GIS to improve water quality and overall public health.



	



Here is a link to a web map I recently learned how to make in my CRP 251 class
